## S.S.S System Architechture

  ## Summary
  A hall effect sensor triggered device that plays audio through a small discreet speaker system. Sensors will be connected to a door to count the number of occurences for an open/closed event. After a random number of occurences, the speakers will play random sound effects to create a fun interactive experience for the user. This project aims to blend the beauty of sound and music with any otherwise boring environment. This device will need to be a small and discreet, along with the speakers being hidden, and the hall effect sensors tucked away from visible eyes. The whole system should blend in easily with most environments. Budget for this project will be approximately $40.
